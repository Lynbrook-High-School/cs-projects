This file documents the contents of this repository, and how the codespace works.

A GitHub Codespace is an implementation of the Development Container (https://containers.dev/)
spec, where pre-built containers can be used as development environments.

In this repository, the `.devcontainer.json` specifies the settings for the devcontainer.
The specification can be found at https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/.

The Dockerfile located at the root of this repository is responsible for bootstrapping the
development container.

It is based off Ubuntu 24.04, which is a LTS version, expected to be supported until around 2034.
When the time comes (if it ever does), update the Dockerfile to be based off a newer release.
The release cycle can be found at https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle.

The Dockerfile then installs node, java, python3, pygame, and all the required VSCode extensions
are installed.

The `docs/` folder contains instructions to setup the development container, the `guide.pdf` file
is typset in Typst (https://github.com/typst/typst).
